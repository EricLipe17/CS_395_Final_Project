# CS_395_Final_Project
Final Project for CS395 Neural Networks &amp; Deep Learning

This Repo contains both the preprocessing and the analysis of the PUBG placement prediction dataset that both Kevin Ritter and I have worked on.
The goal of this project is to predict each players probability of winning the game as a number [0, 1]. The predictions are made off of in game
statistics.
